## Module Overview

If you reached this point and finished all the previous modules, congratulations! You already did a great job! You passed through many parts of the DevOps ecosystem and even finished the end-to-end hands-on guided project, [HiveBox](../../projects/hivebox/) (if you didn't, you should finish it first).

The capstone project will be a bit different, where you will do everything from A to Z, where you will come up with the project idea, define the `requirements,` set the `plan,` work on the `implementation,` and `review` the outcome.

**Focus areas:** Requirements (20%), Planning (15%), Implementation (40%), Review (25%).

:::warning
Unlike the [HiveBox project](../../projects/hivebox/) where pairing is recommended, this **capstone project cannot be done without pairing!** You should do it with someone more experienced than you.
:::

:::tip
This project should follow the same MVP approach and work in phases and always remember ... **Make it work, make it right, then make it fast!**
:::

## 7.1 Requirements

- The goal of this phase is to gather the requirements for the project
- Brainstorm and find the project idea. It should be an end-to-end project and cover most of what you learned.
- Define the project scope and objectives.
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements.
- Define success metrics (KPIs).

## 7.2 Plan

- Decide which agile planning methodology that you will use.
- Create a high-level project roadmap.
- Identify the tech stack that will be used in the project.
- Define a reasonable timeline for the project.
- Make a simple risk assessment to spot the obstacles you know or don't know about.

## 7.3 Implementation

- The goal of this phase is to implement the technical aspects of the project.
- The implementation should be fully documented so anyone can easily understand and run/reproduce it.
- It should cover all focus areas covered in the previous modules.
- It follows the GitOps approach as much as possible. No magic work should be done outside the project's Git repo!

## 7.4 Review

- The goal of this phase is to review the project's outcome.
- Verify and validate each plan phase and match it with the implementation.
- Asset the whole project and what has been done compared to the original plan and goal.
- Conduct a final retrospective and identify future work.
- Write the takeaways of the project.
