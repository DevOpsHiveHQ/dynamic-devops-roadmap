## 1.1 Introduction to Platform Engineering

Platform Engineering is all about delivering platforms to users as products.
These users are usually developers themselves, yet they need tooling for their day-to-day work, such as source hosting platforms, task management, or documentation.
As a Platform Engineer, you will be tasked with delivering and supporting these platforms' reliability and having a product-centric mindset, as this helps deliver the best experiences for the end users of these platforms.

### What you need to know {#11-what-you-need-to-know}

- Platform engineers take the responsibility of infrastructure management out of the developer's hands and provide ready-to-use products.
- They build, maintain, and operate internal developer platforms (IDPs), which are sets of tools and infrastructure that standardize software development, deployment, and operation processes.
- Platform engineers work closely with software developers to ensure the platform is user-friendly and educate them on platform usage best practices.
- They stay informed of the latest industry trends and technologies to make sure that business innovation can continue at high velocity, keeping their organization ahead of the curve.

## 1.2 Platform Engineering Skillset

### What you need to know {#12-what-you-need-to-know}

- As with any other job title, it takes certain skills to be an efficient and productive Platform Engineer and a specific mindset. We will go through these two points in detail.
- A successful Platform Engineer requires a diverse set of skills that combine technical expertise, strategic thinking, and a user-focused mindset.
- The following is a list of key skills needed for a Platform Engineer:
  - **Coding:** Strong knowledge of languages like Python, Go, or Bash to build or automate the platform capabilities.
  - **Cloud Computing:** Expertise in cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, which is usually the cornerstone of the platform.
  - **Networking:** Solid understanding of networking concepts, such as load balancing, DNS, firewalls, and service mesh technologies, to ensure reliable and secure platform operations.
  - **CI/CD Pipelines:** Advanced knowledge of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and a strong mindset for automating and streamlining delivery processes. That could be done using different tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or ArgoCD.
  - **Containerization:** Extensive experience with container tools like Docker and Kubernetes. Especially in managing multi-cluster environments.
  - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Strong skills in IaC to define, deploy, and manage infrastructure in a scalable and reproducible manner. That could be done using tools such as Terraform, Pulumi, or Crossplane.
  - **Observability:** Proficiency in the 3 pillars of observability (`logs`, `metrics`, and `traces`) to ensure visibility into platform health. That could be done using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, or other services.
  - **Security:** Knowledge of securing platforms and infrastructure, which include identity and access management (IAM), encryption, and vulnerability assessment tools.
- These skills collectively enable Platform Engineers to design, build, and manage scalable, efficient, and user-friendly platforms that empower development teams and drive business innovation.
