## Approach

Preparing for the interview is as crucial as the hands-on knowledge. So you need to be ready.
Following the Agile MVP style, each module is linked to common interview questions, so you should be ready for the interview at any phase.

After you finish the module content and the module project, you review the interview questions and ensure you understand each one well (but not necessarily 100%).
