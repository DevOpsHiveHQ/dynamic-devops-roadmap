## Situation

You got [a sample JavaScript application](https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app), it's a simple todo list manager that is running in Node.js, however, no real JavaScript experience is needed. We will just run it.

## Task

- Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize project.
- Apply Docker container best practices to work effectively with top ‚úÖÔ∏è Dos & üö´ Don'ts.
- Create a CI pipeline to automate the best practices checks.

## Requirements

Ensure the following best practices are applied.

- **Essential Practices**
  - Use Dockerfile linter
  - Check Docker language specific best practices
  - Create a single application per Docker image
  - Create configurable ephemeral containers

- **Image Practices**
  - Use optimal base image
  - Pin versions everywhere
  - Create image with the optimal size
  - Use multi-stage whenever possible
  - Avoid any unnecessary files

- **Security Practices**
  - Always use trusted images
  - Never use untrusted resources
  - Never store sensitive data in the image
  - Use a non-root user
  - Scan image vulnerabilities

- **Misc Practices**
  - Leverage Docker build cache
  - Avoid system cache
  - Create a unified image across envs
  - Use ENTRYPOINT with CMD

## Extras

Build:

```shell
docker build . -t docker-sample-app:v1
```

Run:

```shell
docker run -p 3000:3000 docker-sample-app:v1
```

View:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
